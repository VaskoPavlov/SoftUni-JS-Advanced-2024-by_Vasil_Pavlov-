/**
 * Task: Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subset. 
 * In other words, you start from the first element and 
 * continue to the end of the given array of numbers. 
 * Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, 
 * alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set 
 * it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number. 
 * 
 * The input comes as an array of numbers.
 * The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subset. 
 * Return the array of numbers.
